This application allows you to integrate PagerDuty to your Mattermost instance, letting you subscribe your PagerDuty's services on any custom channel to get notified about any update related to your services. Also, allows the user to create or display incidents, watch who is on-call, etc. without moving from the Mattermost window.

# Feature summary

**PagerDuty to Mattermost notifications:** Link your Mattermost channels with the PagerDuty Service you want to track, so you and your team can get notifications about the creation and updates of each incident, with a user-friendly interface that will let you reassign, change priority, add notes, view details and more.

# Set up

## Installation

This plugin requires that your Mattermost workspace has the ``/apps install`` command enabled.

To install, as a super admin user role, run the command ``/apps install http PAGERDUTY_API_URL`` in any channel.

The ``PAGERDUTY_API_URL`` should be replaced with the URL where the PagerDuty API instance is running. Example: ``/apps install http https://mattermost-pagerduty-dev.ancient.mx/manifest.json``.

The ``/pd`` command should be available after the configuration has been successfully installed.

## Configuration

1. First, install the app in your current Mattermost instance (refer to [Installation](#installation)) so that the ``/pd`` command is available.
2. Open your PagerDuty profile to get your credentials and link to your Mattermost instance.
3. Select the **Integration** tab in the toolbar. To the right of the popup (in the **Developer Tools** column) select **Developer Mode**
4. On the **My Apps** page, select **Create New APP** and fill the form.
5. When the form is completed, select **OAuth 2.0** in the same form (on the **Add** button below).
6. In the **Redirect URL** field, add the following link (where "mattermostURL" should be replaced with the link to you Mattermost instance):
``{mattermostURL}/plugins/com.mattermost.apps/apps/pagerduty/oauth2/remote/complete``
7. Select **Save**.
8. The ``Client ID`` and ``Client Secret`` will be displayed. Save them in a safe place - the ``Client Secret`` can't be recovered).
9. To finish, in the **Scopes** select **Read/Write**, then select **Save**.
10. Return to Mattermost.
11. As a super admin role user, run the ``/pd configure`` command.
12. Enter the PagerDuty ``Client ID`` and ``Client Secret`` when prompted.

# Admin guide

## Slash commands

``/pd configure``: This command will enable all the other commands; it asks the administrator for a ``Client ID`` and ``Client Secret`` (which will be used to enable OAuth 2.0 authentication)

# End user guide

## Get started

- ``/pd help``: This command will show all current commands available for this application.

- ``/pd incident create``: Allow any user to create a new incident.
- ``/pd incident list``: Allow any user to display all the current incidents.
- ``/pd subscription add``: Allow any user to subscribe any channel to any PagerDuty service that the user has access.

# Development

## Manual installation

*  Download the latest repository release.

### Run the local development environment

* You need to have installed at least node version 12 and maximum version 18. You can download the latest lts version of node for the required operating system here: https://nodejs.org/es/download/

*  Install libraries: ``cd`` to the project's directory and execute ``npm install`` to download all dependency libraries.

```
$ npm install
```

*  Update the environment configuration file. The ``.env`` file must be modified or added to set the environment variables, it must be in the root of the repository.

```
file: .env

PROJECT=mattermost-pagerduty-app
PORT=4002
HOST=https://mattermost-pagerduty-dev.ancient.mx
```

Variable definition

- PROJECT: In case of executing the project with Docker using the ``.build.sh`` file, this variable will be used for the name of the container
- PORT: Port number on which the PagerDuty integration is listening
- HOST: PagerDuty API usage URL

* Finally, the project must be executed.

```
$ npm run dev
```

### Run the local development environment with Docker

* You need to have Docker installed. You can find the necessary steps to install Docker for the following operating systems:

[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

* Once you have Docker installed, the next step would be to run the ``./build.sh`` file to create the API container and expose it locally or on the server, depending on the case required.

```
$ ./build
```

When the container is created correctly, the API will be running at the url http://127.0.0.1:4002 in such a way that the installation can be carried out in Mattermost.
